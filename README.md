## Description

I use a version of this for the contact form on my personal portfolio site (www.obsidiandesignstudios.com).  I've received a some positive feedback on the feature, so I wanted to share the component with the community.  It's a small, uncomplicated piece of code, but I think it's a cool way to confirm a button click.
